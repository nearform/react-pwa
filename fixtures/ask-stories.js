Users, authenticaiton, authorization, CRUD actions, your usual things. One of my goals is to learn a new language.<p>I&#x27;ve used statically typed languages for the backend for the majority of my dev career (C#, C++, just a little F#). I tried out Python and while I really like it for small projects, parsing data files, and practicing data structures and algorithms I really miss being able to lean on static typing when refactoring. I also miss the strong IDE integration I get with that category of languages.<p>I checked out mypy with Python and it&#x27;s really cool but unless I configured it wrong it doesn&#x27;t apply its type checking across files well.<p>All of this led to me to look at Java and then Kotlin. I love how you only need to type one side of your declarations like I&#x27;m using C#&#x27;s var. The idea of data classes is fantastic as well.<p>Because Kotlin is on the JVM and can interop with Java I&#x27;m hoping I can leverage those libraries and frameworks when needed. For some commentary on the tools, IntelliJ is a great IDE and I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about gradle yet.<p>With all that said, have any of you used Kotlin to build a webapp?
