      Why can’t you raise funding? If you truly have a great product with product/market fit, and established LTV greater than CAC, then you are a perfect investment for a VC who just needs to pour some gas on the fire.
      <p>
        This is exactly the kind of problem a Series A is meant to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if the problem is your competitors are VC funded and are spending more than LTV on CAC, then (1) that sucks, but eventually they will burn out, and (2) you need to find ways to compete with more finely targeted ads that result in higher CTR to outweigh the bid differentials. Or, you need to raise the price of your product to increase LTV in line with the inflated CAC.

      &gt; This hesitation demonstrates the often tense relationship between game preservationists and private collectors. According to a screenshot uploaded by Saint, the private collector threatened to pull the entire folder of content from the directory and stop uploading games altogether if anyone leaked Labyrinthe.
      <p>
        I really can't empathize with the attitude of the private collectors.  It's extremely selfish to want to keep a work "lost" so that your copy is more valuable and special.  This attitude also greatly increases the chance the work will become 
        <i>
          truly lost
        </i>
        , since you'll die eventually and your heirs may not realize its significance.  Why not just take credit for finding and releasing it to the world?

      +1, and the test seems to use php 5.5, this is definitely not OK
      <p>
        Also since we are at php, how Laravel is much faster than Symfony? and why Symfony has so many error?...

      My goal has been to increase protein intake and reduce my caffeine. My body and brain works better when fueled with protein. With caffeine I have to "refuel" every 30 - 60 minutes and snack on stuff but with a big protein meal I find myself not thinking of food or drink for 3 hours of hard focus.

      To add to this, competition with the already wealthy is hard enough as-is, but when large, well-known companies have FREE offshoots in your domain, it’s almost impossible for a company to survive.
      <p>
        Can Snapchat compete with Facebook/Instagram stories? Can a startup compete with Google Analytics? Can OfferUp compete with eBay? The list goes on...

      &gt; Even if surveillance is already widespread, that doesn't make more surveillance a good thing.
      <p>
        I'm one of those types who uses cash, doesn't own a cell-phone, doesn't have Facebook or any of the others, opts for pat-downs at the airport as a form of protest, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having security and surveillance on our ports of entry seems entirely reasonable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem I can imagine is that we're almost guaranteed to run into No-Fly-List style mistaken-identity situations and I sincerely doubt CBP will have reasonable recourse for such mistakes.

      There have been a lot of steps toward automating accounting, and most (lets say 95%) of transactions are instant and require no intervention.
      <p>
        The 5% remaining require human intervention.  In order to close the books faster you would need to either figure out a way to automate the rest (really hard) or hire a bigger finance and accounting staff who would then be idol most of the month.

      Redistribution of wealth is bad enough to begin with, but redistributing it to pad the coffers of political patrons and harebrained unproductive finance that destroys rather than produces wealth really shows you how messed up the system can get.
      <p>
        It seems the productive end up paying immense tax and rent burdens to the unproductive tending moats and establishing political capture and networks, for the supremely undesirable service of making everything worse.
